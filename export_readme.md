**Social Media Copy Templates:**

**For Data Black Hole:**
```
55% of Zambia's waste economy—worth $340M annually—is invisible to policymakers. 

2.1 million tonnes of economic activity disappears into statistical darkness while 155,000 workers remain excluded from systems designed to support development. 

This isn't just missing data; it's a development crisis.

Full analysis: [link to policy paper]
```

**For Mary's Transformation:**
```
Meet Mary. Every morning, she navigates Lusaka's compounds with expertise that remains invisible to municipal planning. 

Digital platforms can change that—transforming her from statistical darkness to integrated economy participant while generating the data that makes evidence-based development possible.

```

**For Dual-Track Solution:**
```
78% of Zambians have basic phones, 31% have smartphones. 

Smart platform design serves both—USSD for universal access, apps for power users. One platform, multiple access points, 100% population coverage. 

This is how you build digital solutions that exclude no one.
